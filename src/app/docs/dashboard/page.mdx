## Understanding Your Returns

### How APY is Calculated
```
APY = (Pool Revenue / Total Deposits) Ã— 365 days
Pool Revenue = Borrowing Fees + Trading Fees + Protocol Revenue
```

### Compound Interest
Interest compounds continuously, meaning:
- You earn yield on your principal
- You earn yield on your earned interest
- Higher frequency = better returns

### Withdrawal Timing
- **Instant**: When pool has available liquidity
- **Delayed**: When pool utilization is high
- **Queue System**: Fair first-come, first-served basis

## Portfolio Health Indicators

### For Lenders
- **Pool Utilization**: Higher utilization = higher yields
- **Available Liquidity**: Affects withdrawal speed
- **Default Risk**: Extremely low due to over-collateralization

### For Borrowers  
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: Current leverage level
- **Liquidation Risk**: Distance from liquidation threshold
- **Position Performance**: Current P&L status
