# Faucet (Testnet)

The Invalend Faucet provides test USDC tokens for users to explore the protocol without using real funds. This is essential for testing, development, and getting familiar with Invalend's features on the Lisk Sepolia testnet.

## Overview

### What is the Faucet?

The faucet is a smart contract that:

- **Distributes test USDC** for protocol testing
- **Provides 1000 USDC per request** (sufficient for multiple tests)
- **Has reasonable rate limits** to prevent abuse
- **Works only on testnet** - no real value tokens

### Purpose

**For New Users**:
- Get familiar with DeFi concepts
- Test deposit and withdrawal flows
- Practice leveraged trading
- Understand protocol mechanics

**For Developers**:
- Test integrations and implementations
- Verify smart contract interactions
- Debug frontend applications
- Conduct security testing

**For Advanced Users**:
- Experiment with strategies
- Test edge cases and scenarios
- Provide protocol feedback
- Contribute to development
